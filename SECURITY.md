# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, do not open a public issue.

Send a report that includes a clear description, reproduction steps, and impact analysis to the maintainers via a private channel.
If no private contact is available, open a minimal issue that requests a security contact without disclosing details.

## Scope
